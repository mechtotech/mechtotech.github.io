# Auto Replenishment of Inventory using Blockchain
 
### Introduction

Walmartâ€™s global presence, with its vast number of retail stores plus its robust and rapidly growing e-commerce business, make it one of the most challenging retail companies on the planet for inventory-related use cases.

Blockchain has been technological basis for many digital currencies, but it is also emerging as an alternative to widely used technology for many other domains. We tried exploring more about the topic of Blockchain, but, being such a generic technology, we needed a specific area of application. After pondering both the benefits it could bring and the needs it could satisfy, we chose to develop a proof-of-concept (PoC) that could apply blockchain technology to a supply chain.

### HyperLedger Fabric

Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain platform for developing decentralized applications (dapps). You can use smart contracts to implement an auto-replenish inventory system on Hyperledger Fabric.

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts in Hyperledger Fabric are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. In the context of auto replenishment of inventory, smart contracts can be used to automate the process of replenishing inventory when certain conditions are met.

For example, a smart contract could be programmed to trigger an order for a new shipment of inventory when the current stock levels reach a specified threshold. The contract would be stored on the ledger and would be executed automatically when the conditions are met, eliminating the need for manual intervention.The contracts are stored on a decentralized ledger, making it tamper-proof and providing a clear audit trail of all transactions.

### Advantages: 

1. Security: Hyperledger Fabric provides a secure and decentralized platform for managing inventory data, reducing the risk of tampering or unauthorized access.

2. Traceability: Hyperledger Fabric allows for the traceability of all transactions, providing a clear and auditable history of inventory movements.

3. Scalability: Hyperledger Fabric's modular architecture allows for scalability and adaptability as the inventory management needs change.
 
4. Interoperability: Hyperledger Fabric enables the integration of different systems, promoting interoperability between inventory management systems.

5. Efficiency: By automating the inventory replenishment process, Hyperledger Fabric can increase efficiency and reduce the need for manual intervention, resulting in cost savings and improved accuracy.



### Disdvanatges

1. Complexity: Hyperledger Fabric is a complex technology that requires specialized knowledge and resources to implement and maintain. This can pose a challenge for organizations with limited technical expertise.

2. Performance: Depending on the size and complexity of the inventory management system, the performance of Hyperledger Fabric may be slower compared to other centralized solutions.

3. Cost: Implementing and maintaining a Hyperledger Fabric-based system can be expensive

4. Adoption: Hyperledger Fabric is still a relatively new technology and its adoption rate is relatively low compared to other solutions. This can make it difficult for organizations to find skilled professionals to implement and maintain the system.

5. Integration: Integrating Hyperledger Fabric with existing systems can be challenging and may require significant effort and resources.
